debian/patches/bts559801_plugin_find_fix.dpatch (Sebastian Harl <sh@tokkee.org>):

  This makes collectd resistant against vulnerable copies of libltdl
  (CVE-2009-3736).
  See <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=559801#15>
  for details.

debian/patches/bts770681_riemann_ack.dpatch (John-John Tedro <udoprog@spotify.com>):
  write_riemann plugin: Receive acknowledge message when using TCP.
  
  Not receiving an acknowledge message when communicating with riemann
  over TCP will cause the riemann instance to eventually hang for
  extended periods of time because of resource exhaustion.

  bts747093_lvm_segfault.dpatch by Jan Kundrát <jan.kundrat@cesnet.cz>
  
  lvm: Fix segfault when there are no logical volumes.

debian/patches/bts770683_curl_init.dpatch (Jeremy Katz <jeremy@katzbox.net>):
  Call curl_global_init() in _init of plugins using curl.
  
  curl_global_init() or curl_easy_init() has to be called in the init
  callback of plugins using curl while collectd still runs single
  threaded. Else, collectd may crash with a segfault due to concurrent
  memory access by curl.

debian/patches/bts750440_config_segfault.dpatch (Wilfried Goesgens <dothebart@citadel.org>):
  Fixed a segfault when handling/including empty config files.
  
  Correctly handle the case of empty "children" nodes.

debian/patches/bts770688_snmp_memleak.dpatch (Pierre-Yves Ritschard <pyr@spootnik.org>):
  Let snmp_synch_response deal with PDU freeing
  
  When reading from tables, upon errors the PDUs sent are already
  freed by snmp_synch_response since they are right after
  snmp_send is called.
  
  This commit syncs collectd's approach with other occurences of
  snmp_synch_response calls.
  
  There might be a few corner cases where we leak PDUs, but it
  is unclear how to check for those since we would need to
  have an indication that snmp_send was never called, which
  as far as I can tell is not possible.
  
  The potential for failure in snmp_send is rather low and will
  be easily spotted though, since when crafting invalid PDUs
  snmp send will constantly fail and since valid configurations
  can never leak memory.

debian/patches/bts770690_java_jni_thread_detach.dpatch (Florian Forster <octo@google.com>):
  java plugin: Make sure cjni_thread_detach() is called on all paths.
  Each call to cjni_thread_attach() much be accompanied by a call to
  cjni_thread_detach(). Some error handling cases were missing the call,
  potentially locking the plugin up.
  
  Also ensure that cjni_thread_detach() does not hide the status of other
  operations.

debian/patches/bts770693_timestamps.dpatch ():
  Fixed handling of timestamps in notifications.
  
  Starting with collectd 5, timestamps use nano-second resolution rather
  than seconds. Notitications did not handle that correctly, leading to
  invalid time-stamps and potentially invalid memory access.

debian/patches/bts770694_loglevel.dpatch ():
  Make sure not to disable logging on invalid log levels.
  
  Debug logging is not compiled into the Debian packages. Make sure to
  fall back to INFO and report and error rather than silently dropping
  all further log messages.
